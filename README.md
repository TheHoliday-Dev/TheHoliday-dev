# The Holiday  

## About Me  
Hello! I am **The Holiday**, a passionate and dedicated developer. I love learning new things and helping others bring their ideas to life.  

I have been working with **Minecraft servers for over 11 years**, successfully managing and developing various projects. My expertise includes **web development, dedicated server administration, database management**, and **Java programming**, with **4+ years of experience in plugin development**.  

Most of my plugins have been private commissions, and I have created a wide variety of systems, such as **mission systems, custom GUI interfaces, generators, and advanced mechanics using NMS**. My goal is always to deliver **high-quality, efficient, and well-optimized solutions** for every client.
